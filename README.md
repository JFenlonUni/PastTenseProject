# PastTenseProject
A project that uses NLP to turn a sentence into past tense


NOTE: For this to work the system you are working on has to have Node.js downloaded otherwise you will get errors at dependency download



Multiple dependencies have to be installed in your workspace for this to happen.
I Used Visual Studio Code as I can keep all my workings for javascript, HTML, and CSS in one place

##IMPORTANT##
within the terminal of the IDE:

    npm install --global nodemon
    npm install express compromise compromise-sentences
    


##Important## 
Run the program from index.js
