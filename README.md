# PastTenseProject
A project that uses NLP to turn a sentence to past tense

During Making this i struggled with differnt issued with the dependencies, were they wouldnt install. so hopefull you dont have the same issue.

NOTE: for this to work the system you are working on has to have Node.js downloaded otherwise you will get errors at dependency download

Multiple dependencies have to be installed in your workspace for this to happen.
I Used Visual Studio Code as i can keep all my workings for javascript, html and css in one place

within the terminal of the IDE:

    npm install --global nodemon
    npm install express compromise compromise-sentences
